An App made for the Chrome App Hackaton in Dublin.

I would like to point ou this was made for a HACKaton the 
code is not pretty and would probably make someone like 
Douglas Crockford and his followers go home take a glass of
gin, go into a corner, curl up in a ball and cry.

Might run it through lint if I have the time later but main
point is don't judge me or my team mate ;P
